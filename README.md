Emediate SDK - Android
===========

This is the Android version of our SDK. If you're just starting out I
recommend reading the, not too long, documentation under docs.

Contents
* docs
* tester app
* sdk

##docs
Documentation for the SDK, start here.

##tester
A tester app for trying out the sdk, if the ad is working in this but
not in your app keep trying. If it still doesn't work, panic. Or ask
us for help.

##sdk
Source code for building the SDK. This is where the magic happens.

##bin
We have provided a prebuilt .jar-file for Java version 6. If you have
an older version things might work, or they might not work. You must
build your own .jar or we won't provide support.

If you have any questions don't hestitate to contact us.
